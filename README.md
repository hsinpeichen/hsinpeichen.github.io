# Hsin-Pei Chen (陳昕霈) - Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my professional academic website, hosted at [hsinpeichen.com](https://hsinpeichen.com/).

## About Me
I am a PhD student in the **Department of Astronomy at The University of Texas at Austin**. My research focuses on the formation and evolution of stars. I previously earned my M.S. from **National Tsing Hua University** in Taiwan, where I conducted astrophysical simulations of evolution of supernovae.

## Built With
This website is built using **Jekyll** and the **Minimal theme**, customized to reflect my professional identity and my current affiliation with **UT Austin**.

* **Hosting:** GitHub Pages
* **Domain:** Custom domain (hsinpeichen.com)
* **Key Features:** * Full-width panoramic header featuring McDonald Observatory.
    * Responsive academic research portfolio with integrated multimedia.
    * Embedded PDF viewer for my CV.
    * Vertical outreach image gallery.

## Generative AI Disclosure
To optimize the transition from my previous WordPress site and ensure a high-quality user experience, portions of this website's design, custom CSS, and Markdown structure were developed with the assistance of **Generative AI (Gemini 3 Flash)**.

Specifically, AI was utilized for:
* **Custom CSS Styling:** Crafting the full-width panoramic header and implementing a consistent **UT Austin** "Burnt Orange" color scheme.
* **Responsive Layouts:** Designing the image galleries in the Outreach section and the embedded PDF viewer in the CV section to ensure cross-device compatibility.
* **Content Migration:** Structuring research project summaries, including the integration of academic links (AAS Nova) and multimedia (YouTube) to effectively showcase my work.

This collaborative approach allowed me to create a professional, accessible academic portfolio while focusing my primary efforts on my research in the **Department of Astronomy at UT Austin**.
